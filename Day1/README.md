# Location list 

## Input 
3   4
4   3
2   5
1   3
3   9
3   3

-> List1 = [3, 4, 2, 1, 3, 3] </br>
-> List2 = [4, 3, 5, 3, 9, 3] </br>

## Steps 

### Part 1 

[ ] Read from file and put the Input accordingly into vectors </br>
[ ] Compare the length of the vectors and check if they are equal </br>
[ ] Sort the Vectors </br>
[ ] Calculate the distance (absolute) between the two points for each entry </br>
[ ] Sum them up and return </br>

## Part 2 

[ ] Convert Second List to HashMap (Number as Key, Value: How many entries) </br>
[ ] Multiply each number in list 1 with the value of the key in the HashMap </br>
[ ] Add those numbers together </br>
