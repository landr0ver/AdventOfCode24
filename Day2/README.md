- [ ] Loop through the rest of the Report and check accordingly to the ascending/descending boolean state
- [ ] If the Ascending and Descending Scheme is true through the whole Report and the distances between the individual number is between 1 and 3 then add 1 to row counter 
- [ ] If the report is safe the row counter should be equal to the report.len() - 1 
- [ ] If thats the case add 1 to the actual safe_report counter and display the value at the end as the solution
